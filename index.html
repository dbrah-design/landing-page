<!-- This note is for the TOP landing page project. Not this one
It seems when I was messing around with the wrapper element and started
to add css with the background color I noticed the outside of the wrapper was
not taking up the blue color I put. I looked at the margins of the body and got rid of the padding.
That seemed to fix it. Also when I added height to the wrapper the background color 
started to expand. Could use this info on the TOP landing page project
