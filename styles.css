/* Got the font family set up to roboto which is a start. 
Next I need to use the css settings from the flex header 2 code to make the nav like the one in the design */

/* Got the header kind of where I want it in terms of spacing. 
But may need to adjust the background color to be in a container in the hero section so it can cover the background all over. The spacing is ok
I just think I need to adjust the margins to get them away from the edges. It looks like I need to do margin left right to get it away from the edges.  Also I don't think I need the left and right classes selected. 
I checked and it's not doing anything. /*

/* Note ,when I changed the a element to nav a it's only specifying the a elements in the navigation. So the logo will now show 
up like a regular a element. Once I bring in the logo from figma into there it should fix that  /*

/* Align items in the header isn't working and pushing the items off the edge of the screen. I tried margin and that didn't seem to work either.
Let me try padding. That seemed to work but the align items center is not working for some reason though. Maybe it will fix 
itself once I fix up all the other elements in the hero section. New note, once I added a height to the header section that seemed to 
fix the issue. For now going to stick to the padding top setting and once I finish up the rest of the hero section go back to it.   /*


/* It seems when I set the font size to 18px on cta btn class, the text split into two lines. Need to figure out why
Update- Turns out I just needed to take out the width and the height and add border 0 none. That fixed the problem. */
